/*
This app uses Bootstrap for quick CSS formatting however if specific custom CSS rules are needed they can be added in the present file.  
If a rule written in this file does not properly apply to the app it's because bootstrap rules usually take priority.
To override this default behavior add '!important' at the end of a rule to give it priority.
